A cobbled together Plex based podcast aggregation channel

it works similarly to cigaras's IPTV channel with relevant rss feeds being stored in a resource playlist file

it automatically finds the podcasts art if any and displays it with the tracklist.

the image handling code could use some work and the codes a mess but this was a personal project of mine that just got too big.
